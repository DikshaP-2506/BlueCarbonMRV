# SIH-CarbonMRV Flutter App

This is the Flutter mobile version of the SIH-CarbonMRV project, migrated from the original Next.js web app.

## Project Structure
- `lib/` - Main Dart source code
- `assets/` - Images and static assets
- `android/`, `ios/`, `web/` - Platform-specific code

## Pages (Screens)
- Auth
- Collect
- Dashboard
- Projects (with New Project)
- Register
- Wallet
- Wallet Setup

## Getting Started
1. Install Flutter: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install
2. Run `flutter pub get` in this directory.
3. Run the app: `flutter run`

## Migration Notes
- All UI and logic are being rewritten in Dart/Flutter.
- Assets from the original project should be placed in the `assets/` folder.
- Navigation uses Flutter's Navigator 2.0.
